This is the source for the AMazer MTE380 project. 

It is recommended you install libraries to properly interface with Sensors (ToF and IMU).

For ToF, install the VL53L0 library from here: https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_VL53L0X

For IMU, install the ICM_20948 library from here: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_ICM-20948_ArduinoLibrary
